Are you a first-time homebuyer dreaming of owning your own home in Tucson or Pima County? The **Tucson Down Payment Assistance Program** (DPA) might be the perfect stepping stone to make your dream of homeownership a reality! Rising home costs can make saving for a down payment challenging, but this program is designed to give you a boost.

## What Is the Down Payment Assistance Program?

The Tucson Down Payment Assistance Program provides qualified buyers with help covering up to **20% of the purchase price** of their new home. This financial aid comes in the form of a loan without **monthly payments**. However, if you sell or transfer your home within the affordability period, the assistance amount will need to be repaid.

## Who Can Qualify?

To participate, applicants must meet these criteria:

- Be a **first-time homebuyer** (or not have owned a home in the past three years).
- Agree to **live in the home** as a primary residence during the affordability period.
- Complete a **HUD-certified Homebuyer Counseling Course** before signing a purchase contract.
- Secure a mortgage meeting program guidelines (**adjustable-rate mortgages are not allowed**).
- Contribute at least **$1,000 of your own funds** to the purchase.
- Maintain **two months of mortgage payments** in savings.
- Meet specific income limits based on household size:
  - $45,500 for a single-person household.
  - $64,950 for a family of four.

## What Types of Homes Are Eligible?

- Homes must be in **Tucson or Pima County** (excluding Tribal lands).
- Must meet HUD’s minimum housing quality standards following an inspection.
- The home’s purchase price must be:
  - **$302,100** or less for existing homes.
  - **$358,835** or less for new construction.

## Why Is This Program a Game-Changer?

Saving for a down payment is one of the biggest hurdles for first-time buyers. With the Tucson DPA program, you get the financial support needed to buy a home and the peace of mind provided by homebuyer counseling. These resources set you up for successful and sustainable homeownership.
