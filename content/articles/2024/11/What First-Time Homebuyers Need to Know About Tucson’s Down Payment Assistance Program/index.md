Are you a first-time homebuyer dreaming of owning your own home in Tucson or Pima County? The **Down Payment Assistance Program** (DPA) might be the perfect stepping stone to help you achieve that goal! With rising home costs, saving for a down payment can be challengingâ€”but this program is here to make your dreams of homeownership a reality.

## What Is the Down Payment Assistance Program?

The Tucson Down Payment Assistance Program helps qualified buyers cover up to **20% of the purchase price** of their new home. This assistance is provided as a loan, but hereâ€™s the great partâ€”there are **no monthly payments required**. However, if you sell or transfer your home during a specific affordability period, youâ€™ll need to repay the assistance.

## Who Qualifies?

To participate, youâ€™ll need to meet certain criteria:

- **First-time homebuyer** or someone who hasnâ€™t owned a home in the past three years.
- **Commit to living in the home** as your primary residence for the affordability period.
- Complete a **HUD-certified Homebuyer Counseling Course** before signing a purchase contract.
- Qualify for a mortgage that meets program guidelines (no adjustable-rate mortgages allowed).
- Contribute at least **$1,000 of your own funds** toward the purchase.
- Have **two months of mortgage payments saved** in a bank account.
- Meet income limits based on household size, such as:
  - $45,500 for a single-person household
  - $64,950 for a family of four

## What Homes Are Eligible?

- Located in **Tucson or Pima County** (excluding Tribal lands).
- Must pass an inspection by an approved inspector and meet HUDâ€™s minimum housing quality standards.
- **Maximum purchase price**:
  - **$302,100** for existing homes.
  - **$358,835** for new construction homes.
