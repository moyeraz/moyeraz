On this Veterans Day, I’m reminded of my own journey in the U.S. Army, where I proudly served from 1998 to 2002 as a 14T Patriot Missile operator. My path started with basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and continued with advanced training at Fort Bliss, Texas, before I was stationed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Those years shaped me in ways that continue to impact my life and career today.

Being a veteran gives me a unique perspective on the values of resilience, sacrifice, and duty—qualities that are foundational in my approach to real estate. The challenges and the camaraderie of military life taught me to be disciplined, resilient, and unyielding in the face of obstacles. These are qualities I bring to my work every day as I help clients navigate one of the biggest decisions in their lives: buying or selling a home.

As a veteran, I’ve seen firsthand the sacrifices made by men and women who serve. The journey is not easy, and the commitment is profound. Veterans carry a sense of duty and resilience that transcends their time in uniform, influencing every aspect of their lives and work. Today, let’s honor those who have served by recognizing their dedication, courage, and the strength they bring back to their communities.

So, whether you’re a friend, family member, or simply a grateful citizen, take a moment today to thank a veteran. Their sacrifices have helped build and protect the freedoms we all enjoy.

Thank you to all who have served, and Happy Veterans Day.
