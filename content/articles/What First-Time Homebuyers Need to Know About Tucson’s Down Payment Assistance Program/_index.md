### What Is the Down Payment Assistance Program?

The Tucson Down Payment Assistance Program is designed to help qualified buyers cover up to **20% of the purchase price** of their new home. This assistance comes as a loan, but hereâ€™s the great partâ€”there are **no monthly payments required**. However, if you sell or transfer your home during a specific affordability period, youâ€™ll need to repay the assistance.
