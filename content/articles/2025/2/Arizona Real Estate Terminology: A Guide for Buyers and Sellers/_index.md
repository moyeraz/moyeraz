## Understanding Arizona Real Estate Terminology  
Whether you're buying or selling a home in Arizona, understanding key real estate terms will help you navigate the process with confidence. Below is a glossary of important terms commonly used in Arizona real estate transactions.

### 1. **Arizona Association of REALTORS® (AAR)**  
The statewide organization representing real estate professionals in Arizona. They provide standardized contracts and industry guidelines.

### 2. **Arizona Purchase Contract**  
A legally binding agreement between a buyer and seller outlining the terms of a home purchase. Arizona uses the AAR Residential Resale Real Estate Purchase Contract.

### 3. **Earnest Money Deposit (EMD)**  
A deposit made by the buyer to show good faith when making an offer. Typically held in escrow and applied toward closing costs.

### 4. **Escrow**  
A neutral third party (usually a title company) that holds funds and documents until all conditions of the sale are met.

### 5. **Title Insurance**  
A policy protecting buyers and lenders from legal claims against the property’s ownership.

### 6. **HOA (Homeowners Association)**  
A governing body in planned communities that enforces rules and manages common areas. Arizona has strict HOA regulations buyers should review before purchasing.

### 7. **SPDS (Seller’s Property Disclosure Statement)**

A timeframe (typically 10 days in Arizona) where buyers can conduct home inspections and negotiate repairs with the seller.

### 11. **Dual Agency**  
When one real estate agent represents both the buyer and seller in a transaction. Arizona allows dual agency but requires full disclosure.

### 12. **Deed of Trust**  
Arizona uses a deed of trust instead of a mortgage, involving three parties: the borrower, lender, and a trustee who holds the title until the loan is paid.

### 13. **Loan Contingency**  
A clause in the contract allowing the buyer to cancel if they cannot secure financing.

### 14. **Short Sale**  
A home sale where the seller owes more on the mortgage than the property is worth, requiring lender approval.
