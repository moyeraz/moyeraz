    title: New Selling Rules Q&A
    items:
        -
            title: Can I still offer compensation to buyer brokers?
            text: Yes, as a seller, you can still choose to offer compensation to buyer brokers to make your listing more attractive to buyers. However, under the new NAR settlement rules, this compensation can no longer be shared on the MLS (Multiple Listing Service), and must be disclosed to the buyer and approved in writing.
        -
            title: How do I disclose buyer broker compensation?
            text: Any offer of compensation you make to a buyer’s broker must be clearly disclosed in writing and approved by the buyer. Your listing agent will guide you through this process and ensure the correct forms are completed. This transparency ensures that all parties involved are fully informed about the terms of the transaction.
        -
            title: Can I advertise my home if I don’t offer compensation on the MLS?
            text: Yes, you can still advertise your home even if you choose not to offer compensation through the MLS. While the MLS doesn’t allow compensation to be advertised, your agent can market your home through other channels like social media, websites, and direct outreach. This provides flexibility to reach potential buyers while keeping full control over compensation decisions through these alternative platforms.
        -
            title: What are seller concessions, and can I still offer them?
            text: Seller concessions are incentives you can offer buyers to make the transaction more appealing, such as covering closing costs or offering repair credits. These concessions are still allowed and can be a valuable tool in negotiating a sale. Your agent will help you decide whether offering concessions is the right move for your sale.
        -
            title: What are the benefits of offering compensation to buyer brokers?
            text: Offering compensation to buyer brokers can make your listing more appealing to buyers’ agents, encouraging them to show your property to their clients. While it's not allowed to list compensation on the MLS, offering it through other channels like websites, social media, or direct outreach can still help you sell your home faster and attract more potential buyers by increasing visibility among agents.
