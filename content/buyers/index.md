    title: Get Your Questions Answered
    items:
        -
            title: Do I need to sign an agreement before viewing homes?
            text: Yes, under the new rules, you must sign a written agreement with your real estate agent before touring homes. This agreement outlines the services your agent will provide and the compensation they will receive. It ensures transparency and helps you understand what to expect from your agent.
        -
            title: How is agent compensation determined?
            text: Agent compensation is fully negotiable and will be clearly stated in the agreement you sign with your agent. You’ll have a detailed understanding of how your agent is being compensated—whether it’s a flat fee, hourly rate, or percentage of the sale price. The terms of this compensation are agreed upon before any services are provided.
        -
            title: Can the seller still offer to cover my closing costs?
            text: Yes, sellers can still offer concessions, including covering your closing costs, as part of the negotiation process. Although the way compensation is handled has changed, buyer concessions like this remain a common part of real estate transactions.
        -
            title: What happens if I find a home at an open house without signing an agreement?
            text: You can still attend open houses without signing an agreement, but if you want an agent to represent you in purchasing the property, you will need to sign a buyer-broker agreement before moving forward with the transaction. This ensures that your interests are fully represented during negotiations.
        -
            title: How do I know I’m getting the best deal for my agent’s services?
            text: The compensation you agree to with your agent is fully negotiable. It’s important to discuss the terms of your agreement thoroughly before signing, and your agent is obligated to clearly explain how their fees are structured. You can ask about different pricing models, including flat fees or percentage-based commissions.
